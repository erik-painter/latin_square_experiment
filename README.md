# Latin Square Experiment: Maximizing Caloric Expenditure

This project investigates the effects of different cardio exercises on caloric expenditure using a Latin Square Design. 
The study aims to explore whether varying workout types, durations, and intensity levels significantly impact caloric burn during exercise sessions.

The experiment involved two participants performing three types of cardio exercises (Walking Uphill, Stationary Bike, and Elliptical) 
across three durations (10, 20, and 30 minutes) and three intensity levels (Low, Medium, and High). 
Caloric expenditure was measured using fitness devices, including an Apple Watch, Fitbit, and cardio machine counters, ensuring comprehensive data collection.

## Key Features:

- Study Design: Replicated Latin Square Design with blocking for duration and intensity
- Cardio Types: Walking Uphill, Stationary Bike, Elliptical
- Participants: Two individuals performing both morning and evening sessions
- Data Collected: Calories burned, duration, intensity, and cardio type

## Goals of the Experiment:

- Determine if different cardio exercises result in varying caloric expenditure
- Provide evidence-based insights for fitness enthusiasts to optimize their workouts
- Contribute to research in exercise physiology and performance optimization

## Statistical Methods:
- Latin Square Design: Controlled for two sources of variation (duration and intensity)
- ANOVA: Used to determine statistical significance between treatments
- Tukeyâ€™s HSD Test: For pairwise comparison of treatment effects

## Key Findings:
- Treatment Level B (Stationary Bike) exhibited the highest average caloric expenditure
- Statistically significant differences were observed between treatment levels
- Blocking factors like duration and intensity accounted for variability effectively

## Future Considerations:

- Increase the sample size for stronger statistical power
- Explore factorial designs to test additional variables
